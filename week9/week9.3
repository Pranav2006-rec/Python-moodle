Given a number with maximum of 100 digits as input, find the difference between the sum
of odd and even position digits.
Input Format:
Take a number in the form of String from stdin.
Output Format:
Print the difference between sum of even and odd digits
Example input:
1453
Output:
1
Explanation:
Here, sum of even digits is 4 + 3 = 7
sum of odd digits is 1 + 5 = 6.
Difference is 1.
Note that we are always taking absolute difference
Answer:(penalty regime: 0 %)
def differenceSum(n):
   num_str = str(n)
   even_sum = 0
   odd_sum = 0

   for i in range(len(num_str)):
      digit = int(num_str[i])
      if (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
        even_sum += digit
      else:
        odd_sum += digit
   return abs(even_sum - odd_sum)
