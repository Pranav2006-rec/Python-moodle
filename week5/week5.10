string values S1, S2 are passed as the input. The program must print first N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.
Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.
The third line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.
Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 10
2 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcbde
cdefghbb
3
Output:
bcd
Note:
b occurs twice in common but must be printed only once.

def find_common_characters(S1: str, S2: str, N: int) -> str:
    # Create sets for each string
    set_S1 = set(S1)
    set_S2 = set(S2)

    # Find the common characters
    common_chars = sorted(set_S1 & set_S2)

    # Select the first N characters
    result = "".join(common_chars[:N])

    return result

# Example usage
S1_input = input()
S2_input = input()
N_input = int(input())

output = find_common_characters(S1_input, S2_input, N_input)
print(output)
